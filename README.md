AUTOMATE EXTRACTION OF HANDWRITTEN TEXT FROM AN IMAGE USING DEEP LEARNING
The industry project is all about extraction of handwritten text from an images, which is optical recognition of characters is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document,
a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image. 
Widely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerized receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. 
OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision. The main objective of this project is to develop machine learning algorithm in order to enable entity and knowledge extraction from documents with handwritten annotations, with an aim to identify handwritten words on an image.
